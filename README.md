## Project 1:  Sales Analytics Dashboard
### Overview and Insights

The sales analytics dashboard provides a unified view of sales for a certain company across three years (January 2018 - June 2020). 

The first tile on the dashboard shows the revenue of the company in the current year (2020). The semi-annual revenue growth is up by 94.6% within the same period from the previous year. 

Furthermore, bikes contribute approximately 96% of the overall sales from 2018 to mid-2020, and the company's major markets are the United States and Australia, each contributing 31.7% and 29.5% respectively to overall sales.

Before designing the dashboard, these were the processes I took: </br>
• Selection of KPIs </br>
• Collection of Data (The dataset used for this dashboard is a free dataset from kaggle.com)</br>
• Data Cleaning </br>
• Data Modelling (I worked with 3 different tables in a CSV sheet, data was modelled in Data Studio) </br>
