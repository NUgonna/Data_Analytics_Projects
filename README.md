## Project 1:  Sales Analytics Dashboard

### Overview
The sales analytics dashboard provides a unified view of sales for a certain company across three years (January 2018 - June 2020). 

Before designing the dashboard, these were the processes I took:
1. Selection of KPIs
2. Collection of Data (The dataset used for this dashboard is a free dataset from kaggle.com)
3.  Data Cleaning
4.  Data Modelling (I worked with 3 different tables in a CSV sheet, data was modelled in Data Studio)

### Insights

The first scorecard on the dashboard shows the company revenue in the current year (2020). The semi-annual revenue growth is up by 94.6% within the same period from the previous year. 

Furthermore, bikes contribute approximately 96% of the overall sales from 2018 to mid-2020, and the company's major markets are the United States and Australia, each contributing 31.7% and 29.5% respectively to overall sales.
